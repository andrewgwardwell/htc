                          This guide is meant to assist in the introduction of critique into a classroom. The steps listed below are based on a process that was developed over the course of many years and informed by the experience of introducing critique into multiple college-level classes. While this guide is tailored to a fairly specific audience the general steps as well as the approach of slowly exposing the group to critique and normalizing the engagement are applicable to a wide variety of audiences and can be effectively employed in many different types of classrooms and workplaces.

It is intended to show students that they already do a lot of critiquing.

Students are asked to both present and respond to work that is clearly not important for the class which gives them the opportunity to give feedback without feeling bad about saying something negative and to receive negative feedback without feeling much attachment to their work.
